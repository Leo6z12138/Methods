            Our story is based on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates in the United States. To understand how the pandemic affected unemployment rates throughout the country, we compared the pre-COVID era of 2019-March 2020 to the recovery phase of 2021-2024. We were initially inspired to research this topic based on an article one of our group members found that illustrated how New York City was finally returning to pre-COVID employment rates earlier this year. We thought this would be an interesting and important topic to research because it highlighted the adaptability of the American workforce and economy during a fiscal crisis. Additionally, it illustrated how the country can work to circumvent future calamities during economic crises. We examined how employment rates fluctuated from 2019 to our current calendar year to uncover the most affected sectors and demographics, as well as how the government worked to alleviate this economic disaster.

            Our first step in researching this topic was to collect data on unemployment rates pre and post-COVID in large American cities. Naturally, as college students in Boston, our first step was finding data relating to our city's unemployment rates. After finding raw data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on unemployment rates in the city of Boston from each calendar year since the pandemic, we decided to expand our horizons and begin to research the effects of COVID-19 on similar cities. Originally, we planned to expand our research to five or more cities, including Chicago, Portland, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. However, after some deliberation, having difficulty finding raw data on unemployment in some of these cities, and realizing that our project would be far too wide-ranging if we focused on too many cities, we decided only to compare Boston to New York City in our project. As New York was the city that inspired our research, and Boston was the place we called home during our time in college, it felt appropriate to compare these two Northeastern metropolises for our project.

            In our final project pitches and plans assignment, each group member worked to find, source, and clean data on unemployment in Boston. After moving forward with our plan to compare Boston to New York City in our final project, we repeated these steps once we found data for unemployment rates in New York City. We created some bar charts in Tableau to compare the unemployment and employment rates of Boston and New York City during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and to illustrate how this global tragedy affected the United States workforce regarding raw employment numbers. We also thought it would be interesting to create a density map for unemployment in the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 to visualize how certain areas of the country were affected more strongly by the pandemic than others. Our density map visualized the median income for families and the unemployment rates in each state during these years.

            Our research revealed that the pandemic's impact was felt more strongly on certain demographics and sectors than others. Certain workforces, such as hospitality and retail, faced more damaging effects due to their reliance on customer presence and face-to-face interaction. Other sectors, such as technology and healthcare, grew during the pandemic due to the need for digital solutions and health services. Furthermore, our research led us to find that demographics such as young workers, women, and minority groups were hit hardest by the pandemic, with disproportionate unemployment rates. Many of these workers were first on the chopping block in layoffs during the pandemic due to working in some of the workforces hardest impacted by the pandemic. Usually, they had less access to remote working opportunities than others.
